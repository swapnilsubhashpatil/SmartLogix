    **Output Rules**:
    - Return a strictly JSON-formatted response with no extra text outside the JSON.
    - **complianceStatus**:
      - "Ready for Shipment": All mandatory fields are filled and valid, with no major violations (import ban considered a major violation).
      - "Not Ready": Any mandatory field is missing, empty, or invalid, or the product is banned in the destination country.
    - **riskLevel**:
    - Calculate riskScore (0-100) based **exclusively** on violations in mandatory fields from "Shipment Details" and "Document Verification" categories, ignoring all other input categories (e.g., TradeAndRegulatoryDetails, PartiesAndIdentifiers, LogisticsAndHandling, IntendedUseDetails):
      - Total possible mandatory fields: 6 from Shipment Details ("Origin Country", "Destination Country", "HS Code", "Product Description", "Quantity", "Gross Weight") + 2 from Document Verification ("Commercial Invoice", "Packing List") = 8 fields.
      - Violation count:
        - 0 violations (all 8 fields filled and valid): riskScore = 0
        - 1-2 violations (e.g., missing Origin Country, invalid HS Code): riskScore = 20-40
        - 3-4 violations (e.g., missing Quantity, invalid Product Description, absent Packing List): riskScore = 50-70
        - 5+ violations (e.g., multiple missing/invalid fields): riskScore = 80-100
      - Specific violations include:
        - Shipment Details: Missing, empty, or invalid fields (e.g., non-ISO country code, non-numeric HS Code, HS Code mismatch with Product Description, negative Quantity/Gross Weight, banned import in Destination Country).
        - Document Verification: Missing or unchecked "Commercial Invoice" or "Packing List", or any sub-item not checked (false).
      - Note: An import ban in the Destination Country counts as 1 violation under "HS Code/Product Description" if all other fields are valid.
    - Summary: Describe risk based solely on these mandatory fields (e.g., "Moderate risk due to missing Origin Country and invalid HS Code").
    - **summary**: concise overview (e.g., "Missing HS Code and product banned in destination").
    - **violations**: List all errors for mandatory fields and import issues (e.g., { "field": "HS Code", "message": "HS Code is invalid" }).
    - **recommendations**: Suggest fixes (e.g., { "field": "HS Code", "message": "Provide a valid 6-10 digit HS Code" }).
    - **scores**:
      - **ShipmentDetails**: 0-100 based on mandatory fields' presence and validity:
        - 100: All filled, valid, and import allowed.
        - 80-99: All filled, but import banned or minor validity issue (e.g., HS Code slightly off).
        - 50-79: Some missing or invalid (e.g., HS Code doesn’t match description).
        - 0-49: Most missing or grossly invalid.
      - **TradeAndRegulatoryDetails**: 0-100 based on validity:
        - 100: All fields valid (e.g., valid Incoterms, positive Declared Value, matching currency).
        - 80-99: Minor issues (e.g., Trade Agreement not recognized).
        - 50-79: Moderate issues (e.g., invalid Incoterms or missing currency).
        - 0-49: Major issues (e.g., Declared Value negative or missing).
      - **PartiesAndIdentifiers**: 0-100 based on validity:
        - 100: All provided fields valid (e.g., proper EORI format).
        - 80-99: Minor issues (e.g., incomplete address).
        - 50-79: Moderate issues (e.g., invalid EORI format).
        - 0-49: Major issues (e.g., all fields empty or invalid).
      - **LogisticsAndHandling**: 0-100 based on validity:
        - 100: All fields valid (e.g., valid transport, matching ports).
        - 80-99: Minor issues (e.g., Special Handling vague).
        - 50-79: Moderate issues (e.g., invalid transport mode).
        - 0-49: Major issues (e.g., missing Means of Transport).
      - **IntendedUseDetails**: 0-100 based on validity:
        - 100: Valid and clear Intended Use if provided.
        - 80-99: Provided but vague (e.g., "Use").
        - 50-79: Not provided (optional field).
        - 0-49: Invalid or nonsensical (e.g., "123").
    - **additionalTips**: Provide 2-3 tips (e.g., "Verify HS Code with WCO schedules", "Check destination country import restrictions", "Ensure all financial details are accurate").
  
    **Validation Process**:
  1. Verify completeness and validity of mandatory fields (Shipment Details: "Origin Country", "Destination Country", "HS Code", "Product Description", "Quantity", "Gross Weight"; Document Verification: "Commercial Invoice", "Packing List") using valid sources.
  2. Validate HS Code format (6-10 digits, WCO-compliant) and ensure it aligns with Product Description using valid sources.
  3. Check HS Code and Product Description against the destination country’s import restrictions using valid sources.
  4. Assess logical consistency of additional fields (TradeAndRegulatoryDetails, PartiesAndIdentifiers, LogisticsAndHandling, IntendedUseDetails) for compliance.
  5. Assign:
     - Risk score (0-100) based solely on violations in mandatory fields (Shipment Details and Document Verification).
     - Compliance status ("Ready for Shipment" or "Not Ready") based on all fields’ validity and import permissibility.
     - Category scores (0-100) reflecting findings across all categories.

//route optimization
const prompt = `
      You are a route optimization AI designed to generate optimal shipping routes between two locations, using realistic logistics data and real-world considerations. Your task is to provide 9 routes categorized into 3 popular routes, 3 cost-efficient routes, and 3 time-efficient routes based on the provided origin, destination, and shipment weight.

      **Inputs**:
      - Origin: ${from}
      - Destination: ${to}
      - Shipment Weight: ${weight} kg

      **Requirements**:
      - Generate exactly 9 routes: 3 popular, 3 cost-efficient, and 3 time-efficient.
      - Each route must consist of 2 to 5 waypoints (inclusive), representing realistic checkpoints between origin and destination.
      - Waypoints must be actual cities or locations with geographical relevance to the route.
      - For each segment between waypoints, specify the transport mode in the format:
        { id: "string", waypoints: ["string", "string"], state: "land" | "sea" | "air" }
      - Verify port or airport existence:
        - For "sea" routes, ensure waypoints have functional seaports (e.g., Mumbai has a port, but an inland city like Delhi does not).
        - For "air" routes, ensure waypoints have operational airports.
      - Multi-segment routes:
        - If a route uses the same mode consecutively (e.g., sea from Mumbai to Singapore, then sea to Japan), explicitly list each segment with its own waypoints and state.
      - Calculate for each route:
        - totalCost (in USD, based on realistic cost rates below, considering weight and distance)
        - totalTime (in hours, based on realistic speeds below, including transfer times)
        - totalDistance (in kilometers, estimated realistically between waypoints)
        - totalCarbonEmission (in kg CO2, based on transport mode and distance)
      - Use these realistic values:
        - Land: $0.15/kg/km, 60 km/h, 0.07 kg CO2/km, add 2 hours per waypoint for loading/unloading
        - Sea: $0.08/kg/km, 40 km/h, 0.01 kg CO2/km, add 12 hours per waypoint for port handling
        - Air: $0.75/kg/km, 900 km/h, 0.60 kg CO2/km, add 3 hours per waypoint for airport processing
      - Ensure distances and times reflect real-world geography (e.g., use approximate great-circle distances between cities).
      - For cost-efficient routes, sort them in ascending order by totalCost (low to high).

      **Output Rules**:
      - Return a strictly JSON-formatted response with no extra text outside the JSON.
      - Format:
        {
          "popularRoutes": [
            {
              "routeDirections": [
                { "id": "string", "waypoints": ["string", "string"], "state": "land" | "sea" | "air" }
              ],
              "totalCost": number,
              "totalTime": number,
              "totalDistance": number,
              "totalCarbonEmission": number
            }
          ],
          "costEfficientRoutes": [
            { ... } // Sorted by totalCost, ascending
          ],
          "timeEfficientRoutes": [{ ... }]
        }
      - Numbers must be rounded to 2 decimal places.
      - Ensure waypoints make geographical sense and align with the transport mode (e.g., sea routes only between port cities).
